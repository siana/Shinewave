   That is the whole API. What follows are some demo functions rewriten from the AdaFruit strandtest code...

Note that we always turn off interrupts while we are sending pixels becuase an interupt
could happen just when we were in the middle of somehting time sensitive.

If we wanted to minimize the time interrupts were off, we could instead 
could get away with only turning off interrupts just for the very brief moment 
when we are actually sending a 0 bit (~1us), as long as we were sure that the total time 
taken by any interrupts + the time in our pixel generation code never exceeded the reset time (5us).
